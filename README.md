# Credit-card-fraud-detection

This project uses machine learning to predict if a card transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset used was gotten from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/version/3

It contains 31 columns including Time, Amount, V1, V2, ..., V28 and Class.
While the meaning of V1 to V28 was hidden due to privacy, Time is the amount of time in seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset, Amount is the amount that was transacted, and class depicts whether a transaction is legit or not. 0 represents legit while 1 represents a case of fraud.
